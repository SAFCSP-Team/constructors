# Constructors

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use the constructors in C++.

### Problem

Update your implementation of the `Employee` class of the [previous project](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/cpp-class-project).

### Implementation
- Write the default and parameterized constructors.
- The parameterized constructors take id, name, and role.
- Create an object of the `Employee` class using declared constructors.
- Call the `printInfo()` method to print object values.

> Use the `Employee` class you implemented in the previous project.

  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
    public:
    /* Add your code here */
};

int main(){
   /* Add your code here*/
return 0;

}
```
